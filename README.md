## Database Design

**16 tables**, 23 migrations, 62 RLS policies. Key design decisions:

- **UUID primary keys** everywhere (no sequential IDs exposed)
- **JSONB columns** for flexible metadata (addresses, preferences)
- **Separate status tracking table** for audit trail on client lifecycle changes
- **Document metadata only in DB** — actual files in encrypted external storage
- **RLS everywhere**: Clients see only their own data. Admin sees everything. Service-role only for sensitive tokens.

```
users ──────────── profiles
  |                     |
  |──── appointments    |──── documents (metadata -> encrypted storage)
  |──── payments        |──── tax_returns
  |──── messages        |──── sms_log
  |──── client_status (audit trail)
  |──── otp_codes (2FA)
  |──── backup_codes (2FA recovery)
  |
  |──── password_reset_tokens    (service-role only)
  |──── email_verification_tokens (service-role only)
  |──── audit_logs               (service-role only)
  |
pricing_tiers (public read, admin write)
leads (anonymous insert, admin manage)
app_settings (admin only)
newsletter_subscribers (separate, no user link)
```

### Tables by Access Pattern

| Pattern | Tables |
|---------|--------|
| User CRUD own data | users, profiles, appointments, documents |
| User read own + admin CRUD | payments, sms_log |
| Admin only | app_settings, client_status |
| Service role only | password_reset_tokens, email_verification_tokens, audit_logs, otp_codes, backup_codes |
| Public read, admin CRUD | pricing_tiers |
| Anonymous insert | leads |

## What I'd Do Differently

- **Start with E2E tests earlier** — Playwright was added in Sprint 7, should have been Sprint 1. The security E2E suite caught real bugs that unit tests missed.
- **Custom auth from day 1** — Started with Supabase Auth, migrated to custom JWT sessions mid-project. The migration was clean but added a sprint of rework.
- **Component library from day 1** — Some early components were rebuilt when shadcn patterns were adopted. Establishing the design system in Sprint 1 would have saved iteration.
- **Separate admin from client earlier** — The admin portal grew to 15 pages. Starting with a dedicated admin layout in Sprint 1 would have simplified routing.
- **Redis for sessions sooner** — In-memory rate limiting works but doesn't survive restarts. Redis integration should have been Sprint 3, not post-QC.

## Roadmap (Gate 17: Launch)

- [ ] Domain cutover and SSL configuration
- [ ] Email deliverability setup (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- [ ] Beta testing with 5-10 real clients
- [ ] Cross-browser and mobile QA pass
- [ ] Analytics and uptime monitoring
- [ ] Square production credentials
- [ ] Client onboarding documentation

## Why Source Code Is Private

This is a **paid client project**. The business logic, client data schemas, and integrations are proprietary. This showcase exists so recruiters and collaborators can evaluate the architecture, security posture, and technical decisions without accessing the codebase.

If you're evaluating my work, the best way to see it in action is to visit [herakles.dev](https://herakles.dev) or reach out at [hello@herakles.dev](mailto:hello@herakles.dev).
